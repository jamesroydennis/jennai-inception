    "# üåç Textile Arbitrage Initiative\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "In a global economy undergoing rapid shifts ‚Äî from tariffs to currency volatility ‚Äî opportunities emerge for agile entrepreneurs to exploit inefficiencies in pricing and logistics. While basic necessities such as food, energy, and water are foundational to life, these markets are highly regulated, capital-intensive, and difficult to penetrate. This project instead identifies **textiles** as a leaner, scalable entry point.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Textiles?\n",
    "- **Resilient Demand:** Clothing remains a necessity with consistent consumer demand.\n",
    "- **Global Trade Exposure:** Textile costs fluctuate sharply due to trade agreements, tariffs, and FX swings.\n",
    "- **Favorable Margins:** Lightweight, shippable, high markup potential.\n",
    "- **Low Regulatory Barrier:** Compared to energy or food, textile import/export is easier to navigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "By targeting T-shirts as a test case, we follow the \"dental floss\" strategy: start small, string across the river, and build a bridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Purpose\n",
    "To create an intelligent sourcing system that automatically scores the best global region to source a textile product from, based on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tariffs & trade policy**\n",
    "- **Currency conversion rates & volatility**\n",
    "- **Supply chain availability and delays**\n",
    "- **Unpredictability Quotient (UQ)**: a combined risk signal for instability\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables any seller or distributor to make better daily purchasing decisions ‚Äî like day trading for physical goods.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚úÖ Completed (Phase 1‚Äì3)\n",
    "**üß± Architecture + DB**\n",
    "- Defined schema with `sources`, `regions`, `products`, `tariff_data`, `currency_data`, `supply_data`, `risk_signals`, `sourcing_scores`\n",
    "- SQLLite backend with configurable path in `config/config.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "**üß† Business Intelligence Layer**\n",
    "- Implemented loaders for tariff, FX, supply, and risk\n",
    "- Seeded mock data for demo purposes\n",
    "- Scoring algorithm combines weights into a final score per region per product\n",
    "\n",
    "**üß∞ Admin Console CLI (`cammie.py`)**\n",
    "- Setup menu: Initialize DB, load mock data\n",
    "- View menu: Show scores, test data ingestion\n",
    "- Update menu: Will later include API pull or forecast updates\n",
    "- Delete menu: Fully restore seeded state with confirmation\n",
    "- Help/Exit behavior available across all menus\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîß Technical Stack\n",
    "- Python 3.11, Pathlib, SQLAlchemy, SQLite\n",
    "- Loguru for logging\n",
    "- Modular structure under `src/business/ai`, `src/data`, and `admin`\n",
    "- Configuration via `config/config.py`\n",
    "- CLI console under `admin/cammie.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìÖ Next Steps\n",
    "1. **Add real-time data ingestion APIs** (Fixer.io, WTO scrapes)\n",
    "2. **Forecasting module for 7-day regional trends**\n",
    "3. **Basic Streamlit or Flask dashboard**\n",
    "4. **Persona profiles for sourcing: budget vs. speed vs. risk-averse**\n",
    "5. **Live MVP demo by week 6**\n",
    "\n",

    "## üí¨ Final Word for the Entrepreneur\n",
    "To the driven woman building her Amazon storefront or Shopify brand: this project is for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "When global economics feel like quicksand, you deserve a tool that helps you plant your flag. Our scoring engine doesn‚Äôt just find cheaper ‚Äî it finds smarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you're sourcing T-shirts or towels, this is your **daily compass** for the global textile market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because in this new era of trade, the informed win.\n",
