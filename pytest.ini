# This file centralizes pytest configuration.

# --- Test Discovery ---
# Define where pytest should look for tests.

# --- Common Options ---
# Add command-line options here to avoid typing them every time.

# Note: Logging is configured in conftest.py using Loguru for rich, consistent output.
# The standard pytest log_* options are not used in this project.

# --- Custom Markers ---
# Register custom markers to avoid PytestUnknownMarkWarning.
markers =
    integration: marks tests as integration tests (can be slow)
    system_check: marks tests that verify system-level dependencies and setup
    contract: marks abstract test cases that define a contract for implementation classes
